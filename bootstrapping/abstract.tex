\emph{Summary:}
How do we authenticate before we have set up the authentication?
This is the problem of bootstrapping: how to enroll entities for the first 
time.
This is also related to recovery: if a user loses the credential, we must be 
able to recover.

\emph{Intended learning outcomes:}
After this session you should be able:
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{analyse} an authentication system and \emph{suggest} proper 
    bootstrapping and recovery.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Reading:}
This topic is covered primarily by \textcite{Gollmann2011cs}, but also by 
\textcite{Anderson2008sea}.
