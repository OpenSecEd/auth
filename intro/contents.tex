% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.


\section[Intro authentication]{Introduction to authentication}

\subsection{Identification and authentication}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{definition}[Identifier]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item An identifier is a piece of data that uniquely identifies some 
        entity.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{definition}

  \begin{example}[Identifiers]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item An email address identifies a user uniquely in the email system.
      \item A username identifies a user in some system.
      \item A passport number uniquely identifies a passport issued by 
        a country.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{definition}[Authentication]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Some entity claims some attribute of some data.
      \item \Eg identity: \enquote{identifier \(X\) identifies me}.
      \item Authentication is about verification.
      \item That entity must \emph{convince} us that its claim is true.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{definition}

  \pause{}

  \begin{exercise}[How can we authenticate \dots]
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item the claim of an email address?
      \item the claim of a username in some system?
      \item the claim of a passport number?
      \item the claim of a national identity in some country?
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{exercise}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[User authentication]
    \begin{description}
      \item[Identification] First you enter your username to \emph{identify} 
        yourself.

      \item[Authentication] Then you enter your password to \emph{authenticate} 
        that you are truly you.
    \end{description}
  \end{example}

  \pause{}

  \begin{exercise}
    Why does this work?
  \end{exercise}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Other attributes}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Identity is simply an attribute.
      \item Age is another attribute.
      \item \enquote{Authorized to read document X} is also an attribute.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{exercise}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item How do you authenticate a claim about age?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exercise}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Some attributes we can verify ourselves.
    \item Some attributes we rely on someone else (\ie trust).
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[Verify ourselves]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I sign a note saying \enquote{Pay 10 SEK for this note}.
      \item I give you this authentication token if I owe you 10 SEK.
      \item I can verify the authenticity of the note when you claim the money.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}

  \begin{example}[Trust someone else]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I ask your age.
      \item You show me your ID card.
      \item I trust the card issuer and read your birthday.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{remark}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Both methods use authentication tokens.
      \item Security depends on forgeability of those.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Time of check, time of use}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{remark}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Whenever we authenticate a user, we do this for a purpose.

      \item When does this authentication take place in relation to when we make 
        use of it?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[Bank office]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Customer shows ID to clerk, clerk verifies account owner 
        (authentication).
      \item Clerk helps the customer.
      \item Customer leaves.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[Personal computers]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item User starts the computer in the morning.
      \item User logs in (authentication step).
      \item User goes for coffee.
      \item User comes back.
      \item User goes to lunch.
      \item User comes back.
      \item \dots
      \item User turns the computer off.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{exercise}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Why is there a problem with the second example (personal computer), 
        but not the first (bank office)?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{exercise}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{remark}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The key difference is that the first (bank) has \enquote{continuous 
          authentication}, the clerk notices if the customer changes.

      \item We need \emph{continuous} authentication for the computer too.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}

  \pause

  \begin{solution}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We can approximate that with \emph{repeated authentication}.

      \item We could lock our system, either manually or by time-out.

      \item We could also authenticate anew when we need to do something 
        requiring more privileges, and if it has been a while since last time.

      \item The computer could monitor the user's behaviour.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{solution}
\end{frame}
