Authentication has always been a central part of security.
An entity claims something, a property or an identity, authentication is about 
verifying or rejecting any such claim.
We will cover a few different ways to do authentication: the traditional 
something you know, something you have and something you are; but also look 
beyond.

Why we want to do this, and how we can accomplish this is treated in Chapter 
4 in~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
Anderson also treats this topic (Chapter 2 in \cite{Anderson2008sea}), although 
in a wider perspective with less technical details.
When you have studied this material you should do exercises 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 
4.6 in~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
